# PSConfigFile


Creates a `Config file` with `Commands`, `Variables`, `PSDrives`, `Aliases\Shortcuts` and `Default Start locations`. 
You can then execute this default config when your profile is loaded, or when a specific module is imported, or you can run it manually. 

This way you can quickly and easily switch between “environment setups” with these default values
